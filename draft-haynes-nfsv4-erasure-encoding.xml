      Parallel NFS (pNFS) allows a separation between the metadata (onto
      a metadata server) and data (onto a storage device) for a file.
      The Flexible File Version 2 Layout Type is defined in this document
      as an extension to pNFS that allows the use of storage devices that
      require only a limited degree of interaction with the metadata
      server and use already-existing protocols.  Data replication is
      also added to provide integrity.

      This draft starts sparse and will be filled in as details are
      ironed out.
      In the first draft, we simply explain the
      semantics changes. As these are accepted by the knowledgeable reviewers,
      we will flesh out the operation description sections to include sub-sections more
      akin to 18.32.3 and 18.32.4 of <xref target='RFC8881' />.
    </t>
    <t>
      Except where called out, all the semantics of the Flexible File Version 1 Layout
      Type presented in <xref target='RFC8435' /> still apply. This new
      version extends it and does not replace it.

    <name>Introduction</name>
    <t>
      In Parallel NFS (pNFS) (see Section 12 of
      <xref target='RFC8881' />),
      the metadata server returns layout type
      structures that describe where file data is located.  There are
      different layout types for different storage systems and methods
      of arranging data on storage devices.  <xref target='RFC8435' />
      defined the Flexible
      File Version 1 Layout Type used with file-based data servers that are
      accessed using the NFS protocols: NFSv3 <xref target='RFC1813' />,
      NFSv4.0 <xref target='RFC7530' />, NFSv4.1 <xref target='RFC8881' />, and
      NFSv4.2 <xref target='RFC7862' />.
    </t>

    <t>
      The Client Side Mirroring (see Section 8 of <xref target='RFC8435' />), introduced with the first
      version of the Flexible File Layout Type, provides for replication
      of data but does not provide for integrity of data. In the event
      of an error, an user would be able to repair the file by silvering
      the mirror contents. I.e., they would pick one of the mirror
      instances and replicate it to the other instance locations.
    </t>

    <t>
      However, lacking integrity checks, silent corruptions are not able
      to be detected and the choice of what constitutes the good copy
      is difficult.  This document updates the Flexible File Layout Type
      to version 2 by providing data integrity for erasure encoding.
      It introduces a new operation RESERVE that allow the client to reserve
      ranges of the data file by creating a reservation file to store
      modifications. When the client is ready, it will use RESERVE_SWAP
      to atomically exchange the blocks in the reservation file with
      those in the data file. Finally, it will use RESERVE_RELEASE
      to start the deletion of old blocks. Both RESERVE_RECOVER
      and RESERVE_INFO can be used by the client or metadata server
      to recover after a client restart or a client which has
      permanently gone away.
    </t>

    <t>
      Using the process detailed in <xref target='RFC8178' format='default'
      sectionFormat='of'/>, the revisions in this document become an
      extension of NFSv4.2 <xref target='RFC7862' format='default'
      sectionFormat='of'/>. They are built on top of the external data
      representation (XDR) <xref target='RFC4506' format='default'
      sectionFormat='of'/> generated from <xref target='RFC7863' />.

    <name>Flexible File Version 2 Layout Type</name>
    <t>
      In order to introduce erasure encoding to pNFS, a new layout type
      of LAYOUT4_FLEX_FILES_V2 needs to be defined.  While we could
      define a new layout type per erasure encoding type, there exist
      use cases where multiple erasure encoding types exist in the same layout.
    </t>
    <t>
      The original layouttype4 introduced in <xref target='RFC8881' />
      is modified to as in <xref target='code_layout4' />.

      type 'opaque'.  The opaque layout is uninterpreted by the generic
      pNFS client layers but is interpreted by the Flexible File Version 2 Layout
      Type implementation.  This section defines the structure of this
      otherwise opaque value, ffv2_layout4.

      <t>
        The ffv2_encoding_type4 (see <xref target='code_ffv2_encoding_type4' />)
        encompasses a new IANA registry for 'Flex Files V2 Erasure
        Encoding Type Registry' (see <xref target='sec_iana_encoding' />).
        I.e., instead of defining a new Layout Type for each
        Erasure Encoding, we define a new Erasure Encoding Type.
        Except for FFV2_ENCODING_MIRRORED, each of the types
        is expected to employ the new operations in this document.
      </t>

      <t>
        FFV2_ENCODING_MIRRORED offers replication of data and
        not integrity of data. As such, it does not need operations
        like RESERVE (see <xref target='RESERVE' />).

        The ffv2_file_info4 is a new structure to help with

        of <xref target='RFC8435' />. I.e., in
        version 1 of the Flexible File Layout Type, there
        was the singleton ffds_stateid combined with the
        ffds_fh_vers array. I.e., each NFSv4 version has
        its own stateid. In <xref target='code_ffv2_file_info4' />,
        each NFSv4 filehandle has a one-to-one correspondence to a stateid.

      <t>
        The ffv2_ds_flags4 (in <xref target='code_ffv2_ds_flags4' />) flags details
        the state of the data servers. With Erasure Encoding algorithms, there are both Systematic and Non-Systematic
        approaches. In the Systematic, the bits for integrity are placed amoungst the
        resulting transformed chunk. Such an implementation would typically see
        FFV2_DS_FLAGS_ACTIVE and FFV2_DS_FLAGS_SPARE data servers. The FFV2_DS_FLAGS_SPARE
        ones allow the client to repair a payload without enaging the metadata server.
        I.e., if one of the FFV2_DS_FLAGS_ACTIVE did not respond to a WRITE_BLOCK,
        the client could fail the chunk to the FFV2_DS_FLAGS_SPARE data server.
      </t>
      <t>
        With the Non-Systematic approach, the data and integrity live on different
        data servers. Such an implementation would typically see FFV2_DS_FLAGS_ACTIVE
        and FFV2_DS_FLAGS_PARITY data servers. If the implementation wanted to allow
        for local repair, it would also use FFV2_DS_FLAGS_SPARE.
      </t>
      <t>
        The FFV2_DS_FLAGS_REPAIR flag can be
        used by the metadata server to inform the client that the indicated
        data server is a replacement data server as far as existing data is
        concerned. The client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> repair the file by using
        RESERVE on the entire length of the file and both decoding the existing
        data from the file and recoding the new data on the indicated data
        server. Note that whilst all data servers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be reserved,
        only the data server(s) to be repaired <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have the RESERVE_SWAP
        operation applied. The remaining data servers can have their reservation
        files dropped via RESERVE_RELEASE.

        Note that effectively, multiple encoding types can be present
        in a Flexible File Version 2 Layout Type layout.  The ffv2_layout4 has an array
        of ffv2_mirror4, each of which has a ffv2_encoding_type4.
        The main reason to allow for this is to provide for either the
        assimilation of a non-erasure encoded file to an erasure
        encoded file or the exporting of an erasure encoded file to
        a non-erasure encoded file.
      </t>
      <t>
        Assume there is an additional ffv2_encoding_type4 of
        FFV2_ENCODING_REED_SOLOMON and it needs 8 active chunks.
        The user wants to actively assimilate a regular
        file. As such, a layout might be as represented in <xref
        target='mixed_layout' />.  As this is an assimilation, most of
        the data reads will be satisfied by READ (see Section 18.22 of
        <xref target='RFC8881' />)
        calls to index 0. However, as this is also an active file,
        there could also be READ_CHUNK (see <xref target='READ_CHUNK' />)
        calls to the other indexes.

        When performing I/O via a FFV2_ENCODING_MIRRORED encoding
        type, the non-transformed data will be used, Whereas with
        other encoding types, a metadata header and transformed block will
        be sent. Further, when reading data from the instance files,
        the client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be prepared to have one of the
        encoding types supply data and the other type not to supply
        data. I.e., the READ_CHUNK call to the data servers in mirror 1
        might return rlr_eof set to true
        (see <xref target='code_READ_CHUNK4resok' />),
        which indicates that there is
        no data, where the READ call to the data server in mirror 0 might
        return eof to be false, which indicates that there is data. The
        client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> determine that there is in fact data.
      </t>
      <t>
        An example use case is the active assimilation of a file to ensure
        integrity. As the client is helping to translated the file to
        the new encoding scheme, it is actively modifying the file. As
        such, it might be sequentially reading the file in order to
        translate. The READ calls to mirror 0  would be returning data
        and the READ_CHUNK calls to mirror 1 would not be returning data. As
        the client overwrites the file, the WRITE call and WRITE_SWAP_CHUNK call would have data
        sent to all of the data servers. Finally, if the client reads
        back a section which had been modified earlier, both
        the READ and READ_CHUNK calls would return data.

  <section anchor='sec_erasure_encoding' numbered='true' removeInRFC='false' toc='default'>
    <name>Erasure Encoding</name>
    <t>
      Erasure Encoding takes a data block and transforms it to a payload to
      send to the data servers (see <xref target='encoding_transformation' />). It
      generates a metadata header and transformed block per data server. The header is metadata
      information for the transformed block. From now on, the metadata is
      simply referred to as the header and the transformed block as the
      chunk. The payload of a data block is the set of generated headers and chunks
      for that data block.
    </t>
    <t>
      The guard is an unique identifier generated by the client to
      describe the current write transaction. It is a 64 bit value, with
      the upper 32 bits being the current time in ms and the lower 32
      bits being the current time in ms on the metadata server when the
      client did an EXCHANGE_ID (see Section 18.35 of <xref target='RFC8881' />)
      operation with the metadata server. The
      intent is to have an unique and non-opauqe value for comparison.
      The payload_id describes the index across the payload.  Finally,
      the crc32 is the 32 bit crc calculation of the header (with the
      crc32 field being 0) and the chunk. By combining the two parts of
      the payload, integrity is ensured for both the parts.
    </t>
    <t>
      While the data block might have a length of 4kB, that does not
      necessarily mean that the length of the chunk
      is 4kB. That length is determined by the erasure encoding type
      algorithm. For example, Reed Solomon might have 4kB
      chunks with the data integrity being compromised by
      parity chunks. Another example would be the Mojette Transformation,
      which might have 1kB chunk lengths.
    </t>
    <t>
      The payload contains redundancy which will allow
      the erasure encoding type algorithm to repair
      chunks in the payload as it is transformed back to a data block (see
      <xref target='decoding_transformation' />).
      A payload is consistent when all of the contained headers
      share the same guard. It has integrity when it is consistent
      and the combinations of headers and chunks all pass the crc32 checks.
    </t>
    <t>
      Note, the erasure encoding algorithm itelf might not be sufficient
      to detect errors in the chunks. The crc32 checks will allow
      the data server to detect chunks with issues and then the
      erasre decoding algorithm can reconstruct the missing chunk.

          Assuming the READ_CHUNK results as in <xref target='crc_on_wire' />,
          the crc32 needs to be checked in order to ensure data integrity. Conceptually,
          a header and payload can be built as shown in <xref target='crc_checking' />.
          The crc32 is calculated over the 3 fields as shown in the
          header and the rc_chunk. In this example, it is calculated
          to be 0x21de8. Thus this payload for the data server has data integrity.

    <t>
      When a data server connects to a metadata server it
      can via EXCHANGE_ID (see Section 18.35 of <xref target='RFC8881' />) state its pNFS role.
      The data server can use EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_ERASURE_DS
      (see <xref target='code_EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_ERASURE_DS' />)
      to indicate that it supports the new NFSv4.2 operations
      introduced in this document.  Section 13.1 <xref target='RFC8881' /> describes the
      interaction of the various pNFS roles masked by EXCHGID4_FLAG_MASK_PNFS.
      However, that does not mask out EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_ERASURE_DS.
      I.e., EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_ERASURE_DS can be used in combination
      with all of the pNFS flags.
    </t>
    <t>
      If the data server sets EXCHGID4_FLAG_USE_ERASURE_DS during the
      EXCHANGE_ID operation, then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support:
      RESERVE, RESERVE_INFO, RESERVE_RECOVER, RESERVE_RELEASE,
      and RESERVE_SWAP. Further, note that this support is
      orthogonal to the Erasure Encoding Type selected. The
      data server is unaware of which type is driving the I/O.

        <t>
          COMMIT_CHUNK is COMMIT (see Section 18.3 of <xref target='RFC8881'
          format='default' sectionFormat='of' />) with additional semantics
          over the chunk_owner activating the blocks. As such, all of
          the normal semantics of COMMIT directly apply.
        </t>
        <t>
          The main difference between the two operations is that COMMIT_CHUNK
          works on blocks and not a raw data stream. As such cca_offset
          is the starting block offset in the file and not the byte
          offset in the file. Some erasure encoding types can have
          different block sizes depending on the
          block type. Further, cca_count is a count of blocks to activate
          and not bytes to activate.
        </t>
        <t>
          Further, while it may appear that the combination of cca_offset
          and cca_count are redundant to cca_blocks, the purpose of
          cca_blocks is to allow the data server to differentiate between
          potentially multiple pending blocks.

        <t>
          READ_CHUNK is READ (see Section 18.22 of <xref target='RFC8881'
          format='default' sectionFormat='of' />) with additional semantics
          over the chunk_owner and the activation of blocks. As such, all of
          the normal semantics of READ directly apply.
        </t>
        <t>
          The main difference between the two operations is that READ_CHUNK
          works on blocks and not a raw data stream. As such rca_offset
          is the starting block offset in the file and not the byte
          offset in the file. Some erasure encoding types can have
          different block sizes depending on the
          block type. Further, rca_count is a count of blocks to read
          and not bytes to read.
        </t>
        <t>
          When reading a set of blocks across the data servers, it can be
          the case that some data servers do not have any data at that
          location. In that case, the server either returns rcr_eof
          if the rca_offset exceeds the number of blocks that
          the data server is aware or it returns an empty block
          for that block.
        </t>

        <t>
          For example, in <xref target='example_READ_CHUNK4args_1' />, the
          client asks for 4 blocks starting with the 3rd block in the file.
          The second data server responds as in <xref target='example_READ_CHUNK4res_1' />.
          The client would read this as there is valid data for blocks 2 and
          4, there is a hole at block 3, and there is no data for block 5.
          Note that the data server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> calculate a valid
          rc_crc for block 3 based on the generated fields.

        <t>
          ROLLBACK_CHUNK is a new form like COMMIT (see Section 18.3 of <xref target='RFC8881'
          format='default' sectionFormat='of' />) with additional semantics
          over the chunk_owner the rolling back the writing of blocks. As such, all of
          the normal semantics of COMMIT directly apply.
        </t>

        <t>
          The main difference between the two operations is that ROLLBACK_CHUNK
          works on blocks and not a raw data stream. As such rca_offset
          is the starting block offset in the file and not the byte
          offset in the file. Some erasure encoding types can have
          different block sizes depending on the

          and not bytes to rollback.
        </t>
        <t>
          Further, while it may appear that the combination of rca_offset
          and rca_count are redundant to rca_blocks, the purpose of
          rca_blocks is to allow the data server to differentiate between
          potentially multiple pending blocks.
        </t>

        <t>
          ROLLBACK_CHUNK deletes prior WRITE_CHUNK transactions. In case of write
          holes, it allows the client to undo transactions to repair the file.

          WRITE_CHUNK is WRITE (see Section 18.32 of <xref target='RFC8881'
          format='default' sectionFormat='of' />) with additional semantics
          over the chunk_owner and the activation of blocks. As such, all of
          the normal semantics of WRITE directly apply.
        </t>
        <t>
          The main difference between the two operations is that WRITE_CHUNK
          works on blocks and not a raw data stream. As such wca_offset
          is the starting block offset in the file and not the byte
          offset in the file. Some erasure encoding types can have
          different block sizes depending on the
          block type. Further, wcr_count is a count of written blocks
          and not written bytes.
        </t>
        <t>
          If wca_stable is FILE_SYNC4, the
          data server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> commit the written header and block data plus all file system metadata to
          stable storage before returning results.  This corresponds to the
          NFSv2 protocol semantics.  Any other behavior constitutes a protocol
          violation.  If wca_stable is DATA_SYNC4, then the data server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> commit all
          of the header and block data  to stable storage and enough of the metadata to retrieve
          the data before returning.  The data server implementer is free to
          implement DATA_SYNC4 in the same fashion as FILE_SYNC4, but with a
          possible performance drop.  If wca_stable is UNSTABLE4, the data server is
          free to commit any part of the header and  block data and the metadata to stable
          storage, including all or none, before returning a reply to the
          client.  There is no guarantee whether or when any uncommitted data
          will subsequently be committed to stable storage.  The only
          guarantees made by the data server are that it will not destroy any data
          without changing the value of writeverf and that it will not commit
          the data and metadata at a level less than that requested by the
          client.
        </t>
        <t>
          The activation of header and block data interacts with the co_activated
          for each of the written blocks. If the data is not committed
          to stable storage then the co_activated field <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
          be set to true. Once the data is committed to stable storage, then
          the data server can set the block's co_activated if one of these
          conditions apply:
        </t>
        <ul>
          <li>
            it is the first write to that block and the WRITE_CHUNK_FLAGS_ACTIVATE_IF_EMPTY flag is set
          </li>
          <li>
            the COMMIT_CHUNK is issued later for that block.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          There are subtle interactions with write holes caused by racing
          clients. One client could win the race in each case, but because
          it used a wca_stable of UNSTABLE4, the subsequent writes from
          the second client with a wca_stable of FILE_SYNC4 can be awarded
          the co_activated being set to true for each of the blocks in
          the payload.
        </t>
        <t>
          Finally, the interaction of wca_stable can cause a client to
          mistakenly believe that by the time it gets the response of
          co_activated of false, that the blocks are not activated. A
          subsequent READ_CHUNK or READ_CHUNK_HEADER might show that
          the co_activated is true without any interaction by the client
          via COMMIT_CHUNK.

          <cref anchor='AI26' source='TH'>
            Automatic setting of co_activated to true if it is the first
            write should be a performance boost. But it can lead to
            the client having incorrect information (as above) and
            trying to COMMIT_CHUNK a payload that has lost the race.
            But is that bad? If you have racing clients, there is
            no guarantee at all as to the contents of the file.

            A guarded WRITE_CHUNK is when the writing of a block
            <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> fail if wca_guard.wbg_check is set
            and the target block does not have both the same change_id
            as the gco_change_id and the same client_id as the
            gco_client_id. This is useful in read-update-write
            scenarios. The client reads a block, updates it, and
            is prepared to write it back. It guards the write such
            that if another writer has modified the block, the
            data server will reject the modification.

            to all blocks in the range of wca_offset to the length
            of wca_data, then each of the target blocks
            <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have the same change_id and

            Some erasure encoding types keep their blocks in plain text and
            have parity blocks in order to provide integrity. A common
            configuration for Reed Solomon is 4 active blocks, 2
            parity blocks, and 2 spares. Assuming 4kB data blocks,
            then each payload delivers 16kB of data and 8kB of parity.
            If the application modifies the first data block, then
            all that needs to change is the first active block and the
            two parity blocks in the payload.
          </t>

            In any other approach, only 12kB of the total 24kB has to
            be written to storage. If that is attempted in the Flexible
            Files Version 2 Layout Type, then the payload will be deemed
            as inconsistent. The reason for this is that the change_id
            for the unmodified blocks will not match those of the
            modified blocks.

            the wb_block is ignored. It <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
            empty. Note that the client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only
            modify both the wb_crc and the wca_owner.co_change_id
            fields in this case. The wb_crc <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
            change as the wca_owner.co_change_id has been modified
            (see <xref target='calculating_crc' />).

          <t>
            For the
            purpose of computing the activation state of the block,
            The data server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> treat this as
            an overwrite. Thus, in the response, co_activated
            <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be false.

          RESERVE is a new operation to reserve for writing a section of a file
          given from the offset of ra_offset to a range of ra_offset + ra_length
          bytes. If the server already has a reservation that overlaps the
          requested range, then the server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return an error
          of NFS4ERR_RESERVATION_CONFLICT and fill in the RESERVE4resconflict
          (see <xref target='code_RESERVE4resconflict' />)
          with at least one of the conflicting reservations. I.e., rrc_offset
          would be an earlier ra_offset and rrc_count would be an earlier
          ra_length supplied by another client (or even the same client) during
          a RESERVE operation.
        </t>
        <t>
          <cref anchor='AI31' source='TH'>
            Or like LOCK, we can use NFS4ERR_DENIED here.
          </cref>
        </t>
        <t>
          Upon success, the rr_reservation_id (See <xref target='code_RESERVE4resok' />)
          identifier is an unique reference to the reservation and it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
          persist across server restarts. As the ra_offset might not be aligned
          on a data block of the server, rr_offset is the start of the data
          block such that rr_offset &lt;= ra_offset. Further, since the
          ra_length might also not be aligned at the end of a data block,
          rr_length &gt;= ra_length. The client <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
          detect the difference and make sure to copy these excess data
          from the data file to the reservation file. I.e., if the
          client only acts on the range of ra_offset to ra_length,
          then it might inadvertantly overwrite the excess data
          with garbage.
        </t>
        <t>
          RESERVE creates a new reservation file on the server and
          populates the current filehandle for it. As the reservation
          file is not visible in the server namespace, the client
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> issue a GETATTR(fh) (see Section
          18.7 of <xref target='RFC8881' />) to get the filehandle.
          The reservation file <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have the exact
          same authorization as the file (see Section 2.8.1 of <xref target='RFC8881' />),
          which means the attributes mode, owner,
          owner_group, acl, dacl, and sacl <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> track those
          of the file. I.e., they <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be modified by
          SETATTR on the reservation file and if they are modified on
          the file, they <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be modified equivalently
          on the reservation file. Finally, the values of time_access,
          time_backup, time_create, time_metadata, time_modify, and change
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> initially be those of the file, but they
          <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be tracked separately from the file.
        </t>
        <t>
          RESERVE <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> check for write access just like
          the WRITE operation. I.e., if the owner does not have write
          permissions, if it is a read-only filesystem, etc, the
          appropriate error <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be returned to the
          RESERVE operation.
        </t>
        <t>
          The server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> persist the ra_key and the ra_client_id
          in order to authenticate subsequent operations on the reservation file.
          These are not visible attributes for the reservation file. The
          server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> not reveal the ra_key in a GETATTR result.
          If the client loses the ra_key, then server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
          allow for local administrative action to release the reservation.
          Note that such means are beyond the scope of this document.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that whilst RESERVE is presented in terms of pNFS and
          the Flexible File Version 2 Layout Type, nothing prevents it
          from being used with non-pNFS servers. I.e., RESERVE is
          not aware of the parallel aspect, it is the metadata server
          and client which are aware of that relationship.
        </t>
        <t>
          As such the ra_stateid follows the rules for a WRITE request
          (see Section 18.32.3 of of <xref target='RFC8881'
          />) for non-pNFS servers and
          the rules for Loosely Coupled I/O for pNFS (see Section 2.3.1
          of <xref target='RFC8435' />).
          I.e., an anonymous stateid is presented.
        </t>
        <t>
          The reservation file <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be recovered
          during grace recovery. The file <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
          recovered and then the client can use RESERVE_RECOVER
          to get the reservation filehandle.
        </t>
        <t>
          A file with a reservation is consisdered opened, even
          if it is not reclaimed during grace recovery. I.e.,
          the reservation prevents the file from being deleted
          by normal means. A REMOVE on the file <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
          result in an error of NFS4ERR_RESERVATION_FILE.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that the entire file can be reserved with ra_offset being 0
          and ra_length being NFS4_UINT64_MAX. This also allows for
          appending data to an existing file. The server <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return
          NFS4ERR_INVAL under the following combinations of ra_length and ra_offset:
        </t>

        <ul>
          <li>ra_length is equal to zero.</li>

          <li>
            ra_length is not equal to NFS4_UINT64_MAX, and the sum of ra_length and
            ra_offset exceeds NFS4_UINT64_MAX.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <t>
          The state of fattr4reserved_state for the reservation file <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
          be persisted to NFS4_RESERVED_INITIALIZED.

    <name>Extraction of XDR</name>
    <t>
      This document contains the external data representation (XDR)
      <xref target='RFC4506' /> description of
      the Flexible File Version 2 Layout Type.  The XDR description is embedded in this
      document in a way that makes it simple for the reader to extract
      into a ready-to-compile form.  The reader can feed this document
      into the following shell script to produce the machine readable
      XDR description of the new flags:
    </t>
    <sourcecode type='xdr'>
#!/bin/sh
grep '^ *///' $* | sed 's?^ */// ??' | sed 's?^ *///$??'
    </sourcecode>
    <t>
      That is, if the above script is stored in a file called 'extract.sh', and
      this document is in a file called 'spec.txt', then the reader can do:
    </t>
    <sourcecode type='xdr'>
sh extract.sh &lt; spec.txt &gt; erasure_coding_prot.x
    </sourcecode>
    <t>
      The effect of the script is to remove leading white space from each
      line, plus a sentinel sequence of '///'.  XDR descriptions with the
      sentinel sequence are embedded throughout the document.
    </t>
    <t>
      Note that the XDR code contained in this document depends on types
      from the NFSv4.2 nfs4_prot.x file (generated from
      <xref target='RFC7863' />)
      and the Flexible File Layout Type flexfiles.x file (generated from
      <xref target='RFC8435' />).
      This includes both nfs types that end with a 4, such as offset4,
      length4, etc., as well as more generic types such as uint32_t and
      uint64_t.
    </t>
    <t>
      While the XDR can be appended to that from
      <xref target='RFC7863' />,
      the various code snippets belong in their respective areas of
      that XDR.
